/**
* A module for dealing with Database storage.
*There are two ways to use databases in TideSDK - HTML5 Databases and the TideSDK Database API. Both API's make 
*use of SQLite backends. 
*
*Opening a Database
*------------------
*You can open databases in TideSDK using the Ti.Database.open and Ti.Database.openFile methods.
*Using Ti.Database.open will create a database which is WebKit compatible in the same directory.
*(Only if the database file doesn't exist.)
*	
*		//Create a database which is WebKit compatible.
*		var db = Ti.Database.open('customdatabase');
*
*Alternatively, you can create a database and open it using the Ti.Database.openFile method. This method
*accepts a file path or a Ti.Filesystem.File object.
*
*		//Create a database
*		var db = Ti.Database.openFile(Ti.Filesystem.getFile(
*									  Ti.Filesystem.getApplicationDataDirectory(), 'customdatabase.db'));	
*
*Querying Databases
*------------------
*Please refer to the Ti.Database.DB documentation.
*
*Note - It is recommended that you store all data in the application data directory and not the application resources
*or contents directory as those may not be writeable.
*
* @class Ti.Database
* @singleton
* @member Ti
